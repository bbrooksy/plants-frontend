What features are required for your minimum viable product?

Signup Form - username, phone number and password

    - `nickname`: String
    - `species` : String
    - `h2oFrequency`: Type determined by implementation

Need buttons to be able to update, and delete the plant

A display page that has all the plants the user has created, maybe a way to see what other users have created as well.

Logout button on landing page to remove token and route user back to home page.
